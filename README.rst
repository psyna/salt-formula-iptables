iptables salt formula
=====================

Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 packet
filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined.
Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain
user-defined chains.  Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of
packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is
called a `target`, which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same
table.

This version of a formula guarantees that manually added rules or rules which
has been added in runtime would be removed.

In order to ensure architecture, proper epoch value should be specified.
Refer to an example.
